# Independent-Study-Summer-2025
This repository contains the files for my Independent Study project at the University of Arizona under Dr. Michael Hammond

This study is taking place from June to August 2025.

---
The objective of this project is to develop a real-time application that can capture text from a live webcam feed and converts the results into natural-sounding speeching using text-to-speech. This tool must offer some kind of accessibility for a range of users including, but not limited to, providing support for users with visual impairments, reading difficulties, or language learners.

 ## Programs
- PyTorch
- Conditional Variational Autoencoder with Adversarial Learning for End-to-End Text-to
Speech (VITS)
- OpenCV
- Tesseract OCR
- At least one additional module that makes the program inclusive and enhances accessibility, such as
 langdetect, deep-translator, speech_recognition, Mediapipe, Flask, etc.
